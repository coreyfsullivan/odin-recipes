        <li>Kosher salt, to taste</li>
        <li>1 stick (8 tablespoons) cold unsalted butter, cut in small pieces</li>
        <li>3 to 5 tablespoons ice water</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For the filling:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 small yellow onion, very thinly sliced</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>4 ounces bacon, cut into ½-inch pieces</li>
        <li>2 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves, divided</li> 
        <li>½ cup shredded Gruyere (about 2 ounces)</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
    </ul>

     <h3>Instructions</h3>
     <h4>For the crust:</h4>

     <ol>
        <li>Pulse the flour and ½ teaspoon salt in a food processor 
            until combined. Add the butter and pulse until the flour 
            looks like cornmeal.</li>
        <li>Next, sprinkle in 3 tablespoon of ice water and start 
            pulsing until your dough begins to come together.</li>
        <li>Now, pinch the dough with your fingers to make sure it 
            holds together. If it doesn’t, add up to 2 tablespoon of 
            ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, and pulse the mixture 
            again.</li>
        <li>Transfer the dough to a sheet of plastic wrap and pat it 
            into a disc before wrapping it tightly and placing it in 
            the fridge until firm. Allow it to sit for at least 1 hour 
            or preferably overnight.</li>
        <li>Roll the dough into an 11-inch round, about ⅛-inch thick, 
            on a lightly floured working surface.</li>
        <li>Line a 9-inch fluted tart pan with a removable bottom with 
            the dough, leaving an even overhang of dough all around.
        </li>
        <li>Press the dough into the edges of the pan and the fluted 
            sides. Then, roll a rolling pin over the top to cut off the
             excess dough. Discard the excess dough.</li>
        <li>Prick the bottom all over with the use of a fork, and let 
            it chill for about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, position an oven rack in the lower third of your
             oven and preheat the oven to 375 F.</li>
        <li>Press a piece of parchment over your chilled crust and then
             fill the crust with either pie weights, raw beans, or 
             rice. Put the pan on a baking sheet. </li>
        <li>Bake the crust for about 40 minutes until it turns golden 
            around the edges.</li>
        <li>When it’s done, carefully remove the parchment and weights;
             return the crust to the oven to bake for another 15 
             minutes until the crust is dry and slightly golden.</li>
        <li>Allow the crust to cool completely for about 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
     
     <h4>For the filling:</h4>
     <ol>
        <li>In a medium skillet, combine the butter with the onion, ½ 
            teaspoon salt, and ½ cup water.</li>
        <li>Cook over medium-low heat for about 30 minutes while 
            stirring occasionally, until the onions are completely 
            softened and all the water has evaporated.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, cook the bacon in a separate medium skillet set 
            over medium-low heat for about 10-15 minutes, stirring 
            occasionally, until the fat has rendered and the bacon is 
            crisp.</li>
        <li>When the onion is cooked, add the bacon to it using a 
            slotted spoon. Then, stir in 1 teaspoon thyme and ½ 
            teaspoon pepper.</li>
        <li>Now, you spread the onion mixture on the bottom of the 
            crust and sprinkle the top with the Gruyere.</li>
        <li> Next, in a medium bowl, whisk the cream with the eggs and 
            ½ teaspoon salt until well combined.</li>
        <li>Pour the cream mixture over the filling in the crust and 
            top it with the remaining 1 teaspoon thyme.</li>
        <li>Bake the quiche on the baking sheet until set and golden, 
            about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Make sure to let the quiche cool for at least 30 minutes 
            before serving.</li>
     </ol>

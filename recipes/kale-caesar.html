     <h2>The OG sweetgreen dupe.</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>For the croutons (optional):</h4>
     <ul>
        <li>1 small day-old loaf of crusty bread</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For the salad:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>12 to 16 ounces green kale and romaine lettuce hearts, in 
            roughly equal amounts</li>
        <li>1 large or 2 small garlic cloves</li>
        <li>4 to 6 anchovies</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Dijon mustard, more to taste</li>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li> 
        <li>½ cup extra-virgin olive oil, more to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice, more to taste
        </li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>4 ounces freshly grated Parmesan, plus an extra chunk for 
            serving</li>
    </ul>
     <h3>Instructions</h3>
     <ol>
        <li>Make the croutons: Heat oven to 400 degrees. Pull the soft 
            bread out of the center of the loaf, leaving the crust 
            behind, and tear the soft bread into bite-size pieces. You 
            should have about 3 cups. Spread pieces on a rimmed baking 
            sheet and bake for about 12 minutes, until golden and 
            crisp. Let cool.</li>
        <li>Prepare the kale: One large leaf at a time, use the tip of 
            a small, sharp knife to cut along the sides of the tough 
            center ribs. (Or, use your fingers to pull the leaves off 
            the rib.) Pull out the rib and discard. When all leaves are
             trimmed, cut into bite-size pieces. (Do not shred.)</li>
        <li>Prepare the romaine: Cut large leaves crosswise into bite-
            size pieces. Leave inner leaves whole.</li>
        <li>Fill a sink or salad spinner with very cold water and 
            submerge the leaves. Swish and let soak 5 to 10 minutes. 
            Working in batches, lift out and drain on a kitchen towel, 
            then dry in a salad spinner.</li>
        <li>Place a plastic bag filled with ice in the bottom of a 
            salad bowl. Pile the washed leaves on top, cover with 
            a damp kitchen towel and refrigerate until ready to 
            serve.</li>
        <li>In a blender (or using a hand blender), combine the garlic,
             anchovies, mustard, a large pinch of salt, about a dozen 
             grinds of black pepper, olive oil and lemon juice. Blend 
             until smooth.</li>
        <li>Cook the egg: Poach in simmering water or in a microwave, 
            until yolk is thickened but still runny. (To poach in a 
            microwave, break egg into a glass bowl or measuring cup. 
            Gently pour in warm water to cover the egg by about ½ inch. 
            In bursts of 30 seconds or less, depending on microwave 
            power, cook egg until white is just firm and yolk is 
            thickened. Hold a slotted spoon over the sink and pour the 
            egg and water into it, so the cooked egg is held in the 
            spoon while the cooking water and any uncooked whites drain
             off.) Put the egg in the dressing and blend.</li>
        <li>Taste and adjust the seasonings with mustard, oil, lemon, 
            salt and pepper. It should be pungent and sharp but not 
            acidic. Blend again, transfer to a container with a 
            tightfitting lid, and chill until ready to use.</li>
        <li>When ready to serve (or up to 2 hours beforehand), remove 
            towel and ice from the bowl and fluff the greens. (If 
            necessary, transfer to a larger bowl; you will need plenty 
            of room for tossing.) Shake the dressing. To the greens, 
            add half the croutons, half the dressing and half the 
            cheese and toss well. Taste and toss with remaining 
            dressing as needed. (If necessary, transfer the tossed 
            salad back to the salad bowl.) Add remaining croutons. 
            Sprinkle remaining grated cheese over the top and grind 
            coarse pepper over that. Serve immediately (or refrigerate 
            for up to 2 hours). Toss once more at the table.</li>
